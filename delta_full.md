Let's summarize how cherry-picking and reverting fit into the concepts of delta (partial) and full branch deliveries, considering our discussion and general Git/deployment practices.

**Core Concepts:**

* **Cherry-Picking:** Selecting specific commits from one branch and applying them (as new, distinct commits) onto another branch.  
* **Reverting:** Creating a new commit that exactly undoes the changes introduced by a previous commit (or merge).  
* **Full Branch Delivery:** Deploying the entire state of a specific branch (e.g., main at tag v1.1) to the target environment. This assumes the branch represents the complete desired state.  
* **Delta Delivery:** Deploying only the *changes* (the "delta") between the currently deployed version and the new desired version. This delta can be defined in different ways (specific commits, specific features, calculated metadata differences).

**Connecting the Concepts:**

1. **Cherry-Picking is inherently a Delta Operation:**  
   * The *act* of cherry-picking is choosing specific pieces (commits) – a delta – from one place to apply somewhere else.1  
   * **Use Case (Delta Delivery):** It's commonly used for true delta deliveries like applying a single critical hotfix commit directly to a main or hotfix branch for immediate deployment without bringing in other unrelated changes from develop.  
   * **Use Case (Constructing a Release \- Less Recommended):** As seen in our Scenario 2, you *can* use cherry-picking to build a release branch by selecting only desired feature commits from develop.2 This *process* uses delta selection (commits) to *create* a specific branch state, which is then often deployed as a "full branch" state (though its *origin* was delta-based). This is generally riskier due to potential missed dependencies.  
2. **Reverting supports Full Branch Delivery by Adjusting Scope:**  
   * Reverting is typically used *within* the process of preparing a branch for a **full branch delivery**.  
   * **Use Case (Scope Adjustment):** You have an integration (develop) or release (release/v1.1) branch containing multiple features intended for release (e.g., Task 1 \+ Task 2). A late decision requires removing Task 2\. You git revert the merge of Task 2 *on that release/develop branch*. The branch now contains Task 1 \+ Task 2 \+ Revert\_Task\_2.  
   * The *subsequent deployment* is still a **full branch delivery** – you deploy the *entire state* of the modified release/v1.1 branch (which now effectively only contains Task 1's changes relative to the base).  
   * Reverting modifies the definition of the "full state" *before* deployment.  
3. **Reverting** *can* **be used for Delta Delivery (Undoing):**  
   * If a problematic feature (Task 2\) was *already deployed* to production as part of a full branch release (v1.1), creating and deploying *only* the revert commit (R1 from Scenario 1\) would be a delta deployment. You are deploying just the change that undoes Task 2\.

**Summary Table:**

| Git Operation | Primary Relation To... | How it Relates | Common Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cherry-Pick** | **Delta Delivery** | Directly selects specific commits (a delta) to apply. Can be used to *construct* a branch state via delta selection. | Applying hotfixes. Constructing a release from specific commits (risky). |
| **Revert** | **Full Branch Delivery Support** | Modifies the state of a branch (e.g., release/\*) by removing changes *before* that entire branch state is deployed. | Removing a feature from a release candidate branch before final deployment. |
| **Revert** | **Delta Delivery (Undoing)** | Deploying *only* the revert commit itself to undo a previously deployed change. | Hotfixing production by deploying only the revert of a bad feature commit. |
| **Standard Merge** | **Full Branch Delivery** | Merging completed features (via feature branches) into develop or release/\*, then merging to main for deploying the full branch state. | Typical feature release cycle using Git Flow / GitHub Flow. |

In essence:

* Think of **cherry-picking** when you need to isolate and move *very specific commits*.  
* Think of **reverting** when you need to cleanly undo previously merged work *while preparing a complete branch state* for deployment.  
* The most standard, robust release process usually involves **full branch deliveries** from main (or tagged commits on main), where main itself is built by merging thoroughly tested integration or release branches where any necessary **reverts** happened *before* the final merge.
