Yes — I can lay this out clearly and step-by-step.
This is a very common and standard Git workflow:
👉 Create a release branch
👉 Stabilize it
👉 Merge it back into main
👉 Tag the release
👉 Clean up

I’ll show commands + explanations at each step.
Let’s go.

🚀 Standard Git Process for a Release Branch

1️⃣ Start from main
You want to start the release process from an up-to-date main branch.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

2️⃣ Create the release branch
Let’s say we’re making release 1.0.0 — we’ll call the branch release/1.0.0.

```bash
git checkout -b release/1.0.0
```

This branch is cut from the current state of main.
Now we prepare and stabilize it (bug fixes, final tweaks, etc.)

3️⃣ Push the release branch to remote
Share the branch with the team.

```bash
git push -u origin release/1.0.0
```
Now people can collaborate on it.

4️⃣ Finalize and stabilize the release branch
You make small bug fixes, version bumps, etc., directly on release/1.0.0:

```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix bugs for release 1.0.0"
git push
```

Once it’s stable and tested → time to merge into main.

5️⃣ Merge release branch into main

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
```
The --no-ff ensures a merge commit, keeping a clear history that this was a release branch.

6️⃣ Tag the release commit
Tag the merge commit with a version number:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```
Now this tag marks the exact commit that is the v1.0.0 release.

7️⃣ (Optional but recommended) Merge main into develop
If you're using Git Flow (with a develop branch), you want to make sure that the release fixes flow back into develop too:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git push
```

8️⃣ Delete the release branch (cleanup)
The release branch has served its purpose. Let’s delete it.

```bash
git branch -d release/1.0.0
git push origin --delete release/1.0.0
```

📝 Summary diagram
```css
main ----o--------------------M---- (tag v1.0.0)
          \                  /
           \- release/1.0.0 -/      
```

o = commit

M = merge commit

Tag is attached on M

💡 Key Benefits of this process
✅ Clean separation of release stabilization
✅ Clear merge history
✅ Tagged release for easy checkout and CI/CD deployment
✅ Team collaboration on the release branch

⚠️ Pro Tip
Always create annotated tags (git tag -a) — lightweight tags are less useful in teams/CI.

If you want, I can give you an example with real commands + commit messages to make it even more concrete.

**great ! and with two branches develop/main (the long lives branches)**


ChatGPT a dit :
**Excellent — now we’re getting into proper Git Flow territor**y, where develop and main are your long-lived branches.
This is one of the most popular professional workflows, so let’s build a clear, step-by-step process with those.

🚀 Standard Git Release Process (with develop and main)

**In this model:**
- main always reflects production-ready code
- develop is where active development happens
- Feature branches branch off develop
- Release branches stabilize a set of changes before merging into both main and develop

**Here’s the clear process:**

🗺️ Process Map
```css
main   -----------------------------M---- (tag v1.0.0)
          \                         /
develop ----f----f----f----R----R--/
```

f = feature commits
R = release commits
M = merge commit (release into main + tag)

⚙️ Step-by-Step Detailed Process
1️⃣ Start from develop
Make sure develop is up-to-date

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```

2️⃣ Create the release branch
Let’s say we’re preparing release 1.0.0

```bash
git checkout -b release/1.0.0
```

This is branched from develop, meaning it contains all completed features so far.

3️⃣ Push the release branch to remote

```bash
git push -u origin release/1.0.0
```

4️⃣ Finalize the release branch
Now on release/1.0.0, you stabilize:
✅ Bug fixes
✅ Version bump (in package.json, pom.xml, etc.)
✅ Documentation tweaks

```bash
# Example
vim version.txt  # set version to 1.0.0
git add version.txt
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.0"
git push
```

5️⃣ Merge release branch into main
This means production release is happening.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
```

6️⃣ Tag the release commit
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

7️⃣ Merge release branch back into develop
This ensures that release branch changes (like version bump or last-minute fixes) also land in develop.

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git push
```

8️⃣ Delete the release branch
It has served its purpose.

```bash
git branch -d release/1.0.0
git push origin --delete release/1.0.0
```

✅ Summary Diagram (cleaned)
```css
main   -----------------------------M---- (tag v1.0.0)
          \                         /
develop ----f----f----f----R----R--/
```
Legend
f = feature commits (branched off develop)
R = release commits (stabilization)
M = merge into main (tagged release)

💡 Why is this powerful?
✅ main is always production clean
✅ develop is always the next version in progress
✅ Release branches isolate stabilization (without blocking feature work)
✅ Clear history and traceability

⚠️ Pro Tips
Always merge release branch into BOTH main and develop

Always tag releases in main

Avoid doing new feature development on release branches — only fixes + prep

If you want, I can also show feature branch handling in this model (off develop) → just say the word.

Vous avez dit :
**why don't you merge into develop and after you could merge develop into main ?**


ChatGPT a dit :
**Excellent, sharp question — you’re thinking like a real Git architect now.** Let’s dig into why we don't just merge the release branch into develop first and then merge develop into main.

⚔️ Short answer: Because develop might have unfinished or unstable features
…and you don't want to release them yet.

💥 Here’s the risk if you did it your way (merge into develop → then into main)
Imagine this timeline:

```vbnet
develop:   ---f1---f2---R---f3---f4---
main:                      (we want to release here)
f1, f2 → features that are done and part of release/1.0.0

f3, f4 → new features that were started after the release branch was created and are NOT ready for production
```

If you merge release branch into develop, you’ll get R (release fixes).
BUT — if you then merge develop into main, you’ll accidentally include f3 and f4 into main (and production).
🚨 That’s bad — those features aren’t ready yet!

🥇 The safe standard process is
✅ Merge release → main first → this guarantees that ONLY what you stabilized in the release branch goes into production.

✅ Then merge release → develop to make sure fixes/changes are synced.

📊 Table of comparison
Process	Risk Level	Safe for production?	Why
release → main → develop	✅ Safe	Yes	Avoids pulling in unfinished dev work
release → develop → main	❌ Risky	No	Might accidentally include in-progress features

📝 Analogy
Think of it like packing a suitcase:

develop = your messy bedroom (lots of stuff in progress)

release/1.0.0 = neatly packed bag with just what you want to travel with

main = airport security (only allow safe, ready things)

You want to pack carefully (release → main), then clean up your bedroom later (release → develop).

⚡ TL;DR
We merge release branch → main first to ensure no accidental inclusion of in-progress features from develop.

**ok excellent clarification, that can work fine with a trunk-based strategy but if we have long lived branches (int, uat, prod) associated with salesforce org each time, that breaks the trunk-based strategy**

ChatGPT a dit :
**Yes — exactly.
Now we’re stepping into more complex release environments, especially common in Salesforce development, where:**
👉 You have multiple long-lived branches,
👉 Each one corresponds to a specific Salesforce org / environment (Integration, UAT, Production),
👉 And trunk-based development starts to get harder to follow cleanly.

**Let’s make this crystal clear.**

🏗️ Your setup looks roughly like this:
```java
develop  → Integration org (INT)
uat      → UAT org
main     → Production org (PROD)
develop (INT) → ongoing work, dev-tested
uat → business testing / validation
main (PROD) → production releases
```
These are long-lived, parallel branches, not short-lived feature or release branches anymore.

❓ Why does this break trunk-based strategy?

Trunk-based development says:

**“Everyone works on a single shared branch (trunk) and we deploy frequently and continuously.”**

But when you have multiple environments and each has its own branch, you are in effect doing "promotion-based branching"
→ Code is promoted (merged) from one branch to the next environment (INT → UAT → PROD).

**This creates branch divergence, which is exactly what trunk-based tries to avoid.**

⚖️ Realistic Trade-off in Salesforce (and similar environments)
In Salesforce, where metadata deployments are slow, testing is org-specific, and environments are tightly coupled to their business purpose —
having branches per environment is often practical and necessary, even if it violates pure trunk-based ideals.

**So — you accept a hybrid model:**
✅ Use "trunk-like" discipline (frequent integration)
✅ But with environment branches to reflect real-world promotion and testing flows

🚦 Recommended process (in Salesforce projects)
Let’s say:

- Branch	Org	Purpose
- develop	INT	Active dev, integration testing
- uat	UAT	User acceptance testing
- main	PROD	Production

Here’s a clean, safe flow:

develop → uat → main
1️⃣ Feature branches off develop
Developers work off develop, merge often

2️⃣ When ready for UAT:

```bash
git checkout uat
git merge --no-ff develop
```

3️⃣ When approved in UAT:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff uat
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release to production"
```

4️⃣ Deploy tags to corresponding Salesforce orgs
(Using Gearset, Copado, or CI/CD pipeline)

💡 Key principles to make this smooth
Fast promotion — Don't let branches drift too long; merge develop → uat frequently

Strict environment ownership — Only deploy uat branch to UAT org, etc.

Automate deployments to keep orgs/branches in sync

Use tags to clearly mark what version is where

Favor short-lived feature branches (merge fast into develop)

🛠️ Is this still trunk-based?
Not pure trunk-based
BUT — it’s a practical hybrid that respects:

✅ Frequent integration
✅ Clear promotion path
✅ Controlled environment releases

This model is sometimes called **Environment Promotion Flow** or **Environment Branching Strategy** — very common in Salesforce, enterprise, and regulated systems.

⚡ TL;DR
✅ You can still apply trunk-based mindset (fast merges, few branches)
✅ But environment branches (INT/UAT/PROD) are often necessary in Salesforce
✅ Key is to promote frequently and cleanly to avoid divergence mess

ChatGPT a dit :
You're asking exactly the right question —
**"What exact branching model am I describing and recommending right now?"**

Let’s nail it down clearly and name it properly so it’s usable in your team discussions.

🏷️ This model is called: Environment Branching Strategy
Also sometimes called:

- **Promotion-based branching**

- **Environment Promotion Flow**

- **Stage-based branching**

📚 Definition
A branching model where long-lived branches map 1:1 to deployment environments (INT, UAT, PROD) and code is promoted progressively from environment to environment through controlled merges.

🛠️ In practice (for you / Salesforce)
Branch	Salesforce Org	Purpose
develop	INT	Active development + integration testing
uat	UAT	Business validation (User Acceptance Testing)
main	PROD	Production

Promotion path
```css
develop  →  uat  →  main
Merge flow
Step	Action	Command
Promote to UAT	Merge develop into uat	git checkout uat
git merge --no-ff develop
Promote to PROD	Merge uat into main	git checkout main
git merge --no-ff uat
Tag release	Tag main release commit	git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

🎯 Why does this model fit Salesforce projects?
✅ Salesforce has fixed environments (can’t spin up a new prod every hour)
✅ Deployment is metadata-heavy + slow
✅ Testing is often org-specific
✅ Business + QA need dedicated environments for sign-off

⚡ Key strengths of Environment Branching
Clear traceability: You always know what’s deployed where

Easy to handle parallel UAT + dev

Reduces surprise features going to prod (because code moves intentionally)

Reflects real-world org structure

🛑 Why NOT pure trunk-based?
Because trunk-based =

"Everyone merges to one branch (trunk) → deploy everywhere fast"
…but in Salesforce:
🚫 Deploying everywhere instantly isn’t realistic
🚫 UAT + Prod need to stay stable and predictable

✍️ So — what are you doing?
A Hybrid model:

Trunk-based discipline (fast merges, short-lived branches) + Environment branches for controlled releases

📝 What to call it in your team docs?
✅ Environment Branching Strategy
✅ Environment Promotion Flow

That’s clear, accurate, and understandable for both devs + non-devs.

✅ Recommended branch protection rules
✅ Example Git command cheatsheet
✅ Merge + deploy checklist template
